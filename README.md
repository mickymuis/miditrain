# MidiTrain
MidiTrain is a MIDI Sequencer/visualizer using a train-inspired score notation system.

## State of development
Currently MidiTrain consists of a graphical visualisation and a MIDI-player based on Qt5. Compositions are stored in JSON format, which currently needs to be handcrafted. Next steps in the development are a GUI that enabled intuitive editing of compositions and the extentions of the current rendering system (most notably clock scaling).

## Building

I have currently tested only on Macos with Qt5. A build file is included for QMake. Please let me know if you need help building or if you would like to help out by testing on other platforms.
